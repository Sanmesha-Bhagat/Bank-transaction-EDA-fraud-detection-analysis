# Bank-transaction-EDA-fraud-detection-analysis
This project showcases my expertise in ETL processes, data visualization, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and tools like Power BI and SQL, applied to real-world scenarios like fraud detection.  
## Steps Performed

### Dataset Description and Study
Loaded the dataset and explored its structure using df.head(), df.info(), and df.describe().
Identified missing values, data types, and distributions of key features.
Studied the dataset characteristics to understand transaction behaviors and potential fraud indicators.

### Transaction Data Analysis
Analyzed transaction volumes across various locations using bar plots.
Examined transaction types (debit/credit) using pie charts to understand their distribution by type and location.

### Pattern Analysis by Time and Demographics
Investigated transaction trends based on the day of the week.
Analyzed customer demographics (age, occupation) using count plots and histograms to identify key temporal and demographic patterns.

### Channel Usage Insights
Examined the distribution of transactions across different channels (branch, ATM, online) using pie charts.
Identified preferred transaction channels and highlighted areas for potential fraud detection.

### Correlation Analysis for Fraud Indicators
Explored relationships among numerical features using heatmaps.
Identified potential correlations between transaction amounts, locations, and other variables that may indicate fraudulent activity or irregular patterns.

### Tools and Technologies Used
Utilized Python with libraries like Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn.
Performed data cleaning, transformation, and visualization using bar plots, pie charts, heatmaps, and histograms.
